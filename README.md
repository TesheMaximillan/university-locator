# University Locator

> In this project I developed a mobile app to locate universities address located in the US:

## Pages
- A home page for displaying list of Universities
- Details page which shows the details for the university location
- APIs > [Link](https://services2.arcgis.com/5I7u4SJE1vUr79JC/arcgis/rest/services/UniversityChapters_Public/FeatureServer/0/query?where=1%3D1&outFields=*&outSR=4326&f=json)

* Along with the university name,address number is located in each universities.
* When the user clicks (or taps) on one of the universities, the application navigates to the details page.

### Details Page
* In the details page, the webapp retrieves data from the API to show detailed information for the univeristy location.
